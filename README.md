# Book-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
This is a Sentiment Analysis Project done on book reviews. The name of the book is taken as input and the review data of the book is scraped from the goodreads website and analyzed. The output is the name of the book, authors name , overall rating
of the book, and two plots. One shows the variation of the star ratings and the other shows the plot of positive, negative, and neutral reviews based on sentiment analysis.
